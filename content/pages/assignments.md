Graduate Assignments
--------------------

### Assignment 1

Review the literature on Japanese politics and write a clear, concise, thoughtful essay (10-15 pages) identifying the central themes, models and approaches. What questions are not fully addressed in the literature? What sort of approach would be more useful? How well have Japan specialists used political science theories? Should they have better anticipated the events of 1993? Which ones anticipated these events best?

### Assignment 2

Write a creative 10-15 page essay on the subject: "The X Policy Process in Japan." (X = the policy area of your choice linked to your classroom presentation.) How do the actors and institutions identified in the first half of this syllabus interact to make policy in this area? Is there a useful model to explain these interactions? Is there a single policy process in Japan? How important is conflict? How widespread is consensus? Has this policy process changed since 1993?
